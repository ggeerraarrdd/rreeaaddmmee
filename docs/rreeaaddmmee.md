## Long Version

_RREEAADDMMEE_ is a README template I've jerry-rigged from various examples for my personal coding projects. It has evolved through many iterations, with its structure and content being refined across multiple projects to suit my specific needs.

Obviously one of those needs is for a format that can comprehensively document my projects, making them clear and accessible to the intended users and, hopefully by extension, lowering the barrier for actual and sustained use. This, in effect, turns the public face of my Github repositories into a platform through which I can contribute to the collective, open-source knowledge base that has helped me many times in my self-learning journey.

The current structure of _RREEAADDMMEE_ follows a logical progression that mirrors one particular user journey—perhaps on their own self-learning journey—through my projects:

After a certain iteration, I began to realize that a README, when roughly drafted at the beginning, can facilitate another kind of journey: building the software itself. As my projects progressed, thinking about such mundane details as what to build and when and how useful my intended users will find what I'm coding has helped to clarify its direction and purpose. It even made the process fun and intellectually stimulating. So why not concern myself about those two critical aspects of software development—project management and the business case—from the start by writing a README first so that I can have that kind of clarity from the outset?

So that’s what I’ve started doing: writing a README first, in the _RREEAADDMMEE_ format, to drive my projects from the start.

I’ve even discovered this README-first development approach has other benefits.

* **Better Time Management:** Clarity of direction and purpose means having a good grasp of the project’s scope and requirements based on my intended user’s needs and perspectives. It also means having set milestones to target and a good definition of what “done” looks like. With these details documented in the README, I am able to make more informed decisions about timelines and priorities.
* **Documentation Momentum:** Writing documentation early while the ideas for a new project are fresh in my mind and before any code has been written captures important context and reasoning that might be forgotten later. This creates a foundation that can be built upon as the project progresses. Early documentation has also helped me established good recording habits.
* **Architecture Planning:** One of the main goals in my self-learning journey is to become proficient in systems architecture and design. Writing the README first has become a useful pedagogical tool towards achieving that goal, as it requires consideration of my project’s major system components, their interactions and potential challenges. This early architectural thinking forces me to do my homework, in other words.
* **Communication Tool:** The README serves as the public face of the project, helping me not only to communicate about its goals, features and progress but also to improve at communicating them. For the intended users, this helps them assess whether the project meets their needs, while helping others quickly determine relevance and avoid wasting their time.

Yes, this all sounds like something you have heard before, even been forced upon you at work, such as Design-Driven Development (DDD), User Story Mapping, Document-Driven Development, Contract-First Development, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), the "define before implement" philosophy of Test-Driven Development (TDD), maybe some elements of Scrum and certainly the systems analysis and design phases in various frameworks from the cottage project management industry. No doubt concepts and practices here and there have been picked and mashed together to move my projects along. They are useful, after all, and can say so from experience. Because it is a byproduct of borrowing and adaptation from that ecosystem, it would not be surprising for this README-first development approach to seem no more than a wrapper around familiar methodologies.

That begs the question: why use "README-first development" rather than one of the more established terms (i.e., has a Wikipedia article)? A README is essentially a document, so why not Document-Driven Development, for instance? As always, context is the answer. We're in Github, where the README is a default feature.

Meanwhile, _RREEAADDMMEE_ will continue to evolve but into what form as informed by what remains to be seen. In its current form, check out these reference implementations:
